    "> ### Question 1\n",
    "> In this question, you have to find the count of **Fibonacci numbers** contained in a list. In the **Fibonacci Sequence**, each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it (starting with 0,1,...). So, the sequence goes like: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. Any number in this sequence is called a **Fibonacci number**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You have been given a few lists to test (list1 and list2). **Find the count of all numbers in each list which are Fibonacci numbers (Use loops to solve this problem).** <br> Eg. in a list `[2, 9, 13, 55, 56, 22]`: 2, 13 and 55  are fibonacci numbers, hence the count is `3`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `Hint`: A number _'n'_ is a fibonacci number if one or both of the expressions $(5\\cdot n^2 + 4)$ or $(5\\cdot n^2 â€“ 4)$ are perfect squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Solve the problem in following steps:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. Write a function `is_perfect_square(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is a perfect square and `False` otherwise. For example, `is_perfect_square(9)` returns `True`. (This function has already been given)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2. Write a function `is_fibonacci(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is a Fibonacci number and `False` otherwise.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3. Write a function `count_fibonacci(flist)` that loops through the elements of the list `flist` and returns the total number of Fibonacci numbers >contained in the list.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">4. If you can get this to work, try rewriting the `count_fibonacci(flist)` function so that it **uses a list comprehension rather than a loop.**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">5. **Bonus question:** can you solve the entire problem in one line of code?"
